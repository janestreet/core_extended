(** This module implements efficient and compact arrays of boolean values. It stores its
    values in the bits of an integer, using multiple integers to allow for arrays larger
    than the machine word size. All operations are on immediates (no caml_modify), and are
    quite simple. Hence this data structure should be more efficient than an array of
    bools. *)

    is out of bounds. *)

(** [fold t ~init ~f] Fold over the array as in [Array.fold] *)
