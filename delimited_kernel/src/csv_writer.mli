 * Compliant simple CSV writer.
 *
 * This library is designed to deal with proper CSV (no quotes allowed in the
 * middle of the fields...). It is fast and flexible: by splitting most
 * writing functions in two parts one that gives the length of the string to
 * write and another that writes the result in a subpart of another string we
 * avoid unnecessary string creations.

(** Prints a valid csv file to a given channel.
    The [eol] arg can be used to override the default line ending
    of "\r\n" (DOS line endings).
    Example ~eol:`Unix to get *nix line endings
