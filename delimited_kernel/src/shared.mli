(** Kitchen-sink module for functions shared by multiple parsers. *)

(** If strip is true (default is false) then spaces will be stripped from the beginning
    and end of fields.

    If [skip_lines] is given then that number of lines will be read and discarded from the
    top of the file or Reader.t given.

    If [on_parse_error] is `Raise any lines that fail to parse will raise an exception.
    If `Handle is given the offending line will be passed to the function given, which may
    then indicate that processing should continue or finish.
